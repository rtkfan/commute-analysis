* Commute Analysis (using Strava data)

This work takes Strava data (currently imported by https://flink.run but maybe fetched automatically via API in future), does some basic data manipulation to format the data for simple analysis, and then makes some pretty graphs.

By understanding how long my commutes take, hopefully I'll be able to figure out how close I can cut it for that 9AM meeting in the office...
